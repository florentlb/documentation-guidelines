At your arrival, the IT should provide you a list of account credentials. These credentials will allow you to access all Talend services.

If you don’t have access to any of the following services, please inform your manager.

Make sure you have access to all of the following platforms.

## Communication

### E-mail

You will be assigned an e-mail account so you do not have to create or request one, but:
* Make sure that your e-mail address has no typo.
* When using Microsoft Outlook WEB Access, go to [https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?realm=talend.com](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?realm=talend.com) and fill in your e-mail credentials to log in.

These credentials are your Okta credentials (Single-Sign On). 

### Slack

Slack is the messaging tool used at Talend for instant communications within the R&D team. All R&D members (including your colleagues from the Doc Team) are available by default in your contact list!

## Okta

[Okta](https://talend.okta.com) gives you access to many employee platforms used at Talend.

## Help platforms

You can login to help platforms through Okta.

### Talend Community

Talend Community ([https://community.talend.com/](https://community.talend.com/)) is the place where the community ask questions about the products. When you will know how to use the products, you will be able to answer their questions.

### Talend Help Center (THC)

Talend Help Center or THC ([https://help.talend.com/display/HOME/Welcome](https://help.talend.com/display/HOME/Welcome)) is the place where the online documentation is stored. The documentation is uploaded there every release.

## Github

Talend uses Github, an open source version control system, to store the product documentation source files so that all technical writers and translators can access it and share their modifications and upgrades. For more information on Github, see [Managing Documentation on Github](https://in.talend.com/work/groups/rd/documentation/wiki/?display=https://wiki.talend.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=6325053). If you cannot access your Github account, create a Zendesk ticket; your connection problem will be solved.

## TalendForge

TalendForge ([https://www.talendforge.org/](https://www.talendforge.org/)) gives you access to the forum, the bugtracker and Babili. You can also access the tutorials ([https://community.talend.com/t5/custom/page/page-id/Tutorials](https://community.talend.com/t5/custom/page/page-id/Tutorials)) which will help you to learn how to use Talend products.

### JIRA

Talend uses Jira to report and track bugs including new features or feature enhancements that we, at the doc team, are required to document.

To request a Jira account:

1. Go to the signup page at [http://jira.talendforge.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa](http://jira.talendforge.org/secure/Signup%21default.jspa)
2. Fill in your username, which should preferably be your e-mail account
3. Fill in your password
4. Fill in your e-mail address
5. Fill in the check code displayed on the page
6. Click Sign up.

You will receive an account signup e-mail containing relevant notifications, including your account details. You can now log in to Jira with your username and password.

You can also assign some “bugs” to yourself in order to keep track of the things you have to do.

For more details about Jira procedures, see [this document](contributing_jira.md).

### Babili

Babili ([https://www.talendforge.org/babili/](https://www.talendforge.org/babili/)) is a community based translation platform. It is the place where the community can contribute to the translation of the software. Do not hesitate to contribute!

Babili is the only application where you need to enter your full email address to log in.

## Intranet

The Intranet ([http://intranet.talend.com/](http://intranet.talend.com/)) is a resource which gives you access to the following services:

- The License Manager
- The insider (where you can find information on Talend employees and Talend news)
- The signature generator
- Zendesk (where you can report issues to the IT)

You can use the Signature Generator program to generate your e-mail signature.

## Wiki (now on TalendIn)

The wiki ([https://wiki.talend.com/display/documentation/Documentation+team%27s+Wiki](https://wiki.talend.com/display/documentation/Documentation+team%27s+Wiki)) is the place where you can find a lot of information and procedures.

Once you’re connected to the wiki:

1. Join the “Documentation Team” group.
2. Update your profile.
3. Add a photo (it’s more pleasant to see people faces when they post something!).

We strongly advise you to read the “[Style and usage](https://wiki.talend.com/display/documentation/Style+and+usage)” and “[Introduction to Minimalism](https://wiki.talend.com/display/documentation/Introduction+to+Minimalism)” pages.

## Servers

The documentation team uses the following servers:

- Newbuild ([http://newbuild.talend.com/builds/](http://newbuild.talend.com/builds/)) is the server on which the final documentation is uploaded.
- Jenkins ([http://newbuild.talend.com:8180/](http://newbuild.talend.com:8180/)) is the server on which the building operations are performed.

You should have access to these servers with your username and password.
