Welcome to **Talend**!
This document will help you get started with your new role at Talend.

Use this checklist to make sure you have everything you will need as a member of the doc team.

1. Install **Slack** on your machine. Before anything else, installing Slack allows you to access all relevant communication channels, and to meet your team!!
2. Install other [required tools](onboarding_tools.md) on your machine and [setup your DITA environment](onboarding_dita_env.md).
3. Check that you can [access the different Talend platforms](onboarding_accounts.md) and that you have an account for each, especially:
    - Okta is a central point that you can use to access many resources, including learning and help platforms, administrative tools, etc.
    - [help.talend.com, aka THC - Talend Help Center](http://help.talend.com) is our production documentation portal, powered by FluidTopics.
    - [JIRA](https://jira.talendforge.org) is our issue tracker. The documentation project is DOCT. You may also contribute to other projects, depending on your tasks.
4. Follow relevant training courses. You can access the Employee training portal via Okta.
